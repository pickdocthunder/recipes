Slow Cooker Italian Beef
note, I have no idea where this came from or if it is any good :)

3 cups beef broth or stock
1 tsp salt
1 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried basil
1 tsp onion salt
1 tsp dried parsley
1 tsp garlic powder
1 bay leaf
1/2 tsp dried red pepper flakes (or more to taste)
2 (.7 oz) pkgs dried Italian salad dressing mix
"1 (5 pound) rump roast (bottom round also works) 
     - can use chuck roast if you want to shred not slice the meat"


Combine broth/stock with salt, pepper, oregano, basil, onion salt, parsley, garlic powder, bay leaf, red pepper flakes and dried salad dressing mix in a sauce pan.  Stir well and bring to boil.  

Let broth mixture cool.  Pierce meat with large fork.  Place meat and broth mixture in large zip-lock bag in refrigerator for up to 24 hours, turning occasionally.

Place roast in slow cooker and pour broth mixture over meat.

Cover and cook on low for 10-12 hours or High for 4-5 hours.  Remove bay leaf and shred meat with fork.  Can also cool meat for several hours and slice thinly.  Serve on toasted rolls with provolone and/or mozzarella cheese and warmed meat juices.


NOTE>>> can put the red pepper flakes in cheesecloth or tea ball so they can be removed afterward without disturbing the remaining spices
